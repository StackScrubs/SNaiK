# SNaiK
Machine learning project made by third year computer science bachelors Magnus Hektoen Steensland, Tommy René Sætre, Norbert Arkadiusz Gõrke and Christian Ryddheim Dahlin.

## Project
The goal of the project was to create an enviroment for a snake game, and implement three ways for the agent (the snake) to play:

* Random action-choice
* Through Q-learing
* Through Deep Q-learning (DQN)

Further, the group were to gather data and create graphs of the different models' perfomance, and compare the results.
